# rpg-random-encounters

With this web tool for tabletop role-playing games a game master can create 
"games" in which random encounters can be generated for players to interact 
with (narrated to them verbally by the game master). The generated encounters 
can be influenced by the campaign parameters selected by the user. 
Each user is a basic user (a game master).

  encounter table.
